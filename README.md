# 🚀 Next.js Project with Crater Detection and Live ISS Location Tracking 🌕🛰️

Welcome to the Next.js project that showcases two exciting sub-projects:

1. **Crater Detection** 🌕🪐
2. **Live ISS Location Tracking** 🚀🛰️

## 🛠️ Project Overview

### 1. Crater Detection 🌕🪐

This sub-project is dedicated to detecting and analyzing craters on the surfaces of the Moon and other planetary bodies. By identifying these craters, we gain valuable insights into the history and geological activity of celestial bodies.

#### Features

- **🌍 Multi-Planetary Analysis**: Detects craters on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury for comparative analysis.
- **🤖 Automated Crater Detection**: Identifies and marks craters in high-resolution images using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.
- **🔗 Data Integration**: Supports data from spacecraft imagery and satellite data for comprehensive analysis.
- **🎯 High Accuracy Bounding Boxes**: Highlights the exact location and size of craters with precise bounding boxes.
- **📊 Crater Size Distribution Analysis**: Analyzes crater size distribution to provide insights into impact history and surface age.
- **📑 Data Export and Reporting**: Generates detailed reports and visual summaries, which can be exported for further study or presentation.

### 2. Live ISS Location Tracking 🚀🛰️

This sub-project provides real-time tracking and visualization of the International Space Station (ISS) using Leaflet on a Next.js website.

#### Features

- **🌐 Open Notify API**: Accesses real-time ISS coordinates.
- **🗺️ Interactive Map**: Displays the ISS’s trajectory on an interactive Leaflet map.
- **🔄 OpenCage Reverse Geocoding**: Converts coordinates into human-readable location information.
- **📈 Dynamic Polyline**: Draws the ISS’s trajectory on the map using a dynamic polyline.
- **⏱️ Real-time Visualization**: Updates the map in real-time based on the latest trajectory data.
- **🔢 Coordinate Conversion**: Converts raw orbital coordinates to latitude and longitude for accurate mapping.

## 🚀 Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

## 📂 Usage

### 🌋 Crater Detection
- Navigate to the `crater-detection` directory to run analysis scripts and view results.
- Follow the provided instructions in that directory to start your crater detection journey.

### 🛰️ ISS Location Tracking
- Visit the `live-iss-location` directory to see the real-time ISS tracking map.
- The `ISSMap` component uses **Leaflet** to display the ISS's trajectory on an interactive map.
